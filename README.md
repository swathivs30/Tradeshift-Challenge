# Tradeshift-Challenge
This is a repo which can be treated as a submission for Tradeshift's tech  Challenge

Please navigate to the folder "my-app" and follow the README instrcutions as usual for a create react app.

In the span of two hours, I was able to componentize the app into a container componenent which uses some presentational components.
I have not included SASS, but attempted to BEM-fy the class names. 

The code as such utilizes very little info fromt he fetched data. The following is a list of features I would have tried to incorporate
if there was more time/design resources and better to make API requests and integrate with third party libraries. 

//TODO
1. Integrate google API to determien the name of the location/area for which I have the lat/long. 
2. Have a landing page whcih would allow the user to input the lat/long so that the user is able to see a spinner state whcih specifies that
we are workign on fetching the weather forecast for a specific area (display the name)
3. Have a more granular component library
4. SASS
5. better icons which are displayed dynamically based on the type of icon specified in the data.
6. a table of hourly weather forecast

Please let me know if you have any questions.
